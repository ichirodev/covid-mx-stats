### Atention
-  Postgres information should be updated inside [`server/index.js`](server/index.js) where dbClient is declared, otherwise it will never make any connection to the Postgres server/db.
- To create the required Database you can use the script [`server/database.sql`](server/database.sql)

To fill the database with the latest data about covid download the database content in csv format from the [official government site](https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/datos-abiertos-152127). Move the file to the server folder and rename it to COVID19MEXICO.csv, and then run the next command.
```
cd server; npm run fill-db
```

The data about COVID shown in this project is given by the Mexico's government on its open data site. I don't own any of that information.
